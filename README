Welcome to our game of Scrabble. We have tried our best to replicate the original games features as closely as possible. Please note
that we are only two members on our group who have contributed to the project. After Milestone 2, neither of the other two members
have contributed to the project so we spoke to the professor and they were removed from the group. With that being said, we have
done our best to complete the project as best as we could with the time we had, any easier marking scheme or aid would be greatly
appreciated considering it was just the two of us working on a 3-4 person project. Thank you for your time and consideration.
